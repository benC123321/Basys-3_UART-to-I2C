"# Basys-3_UART-to-I2C" 
The two submodules are meant to be used together to use a PC to send/receive UART messages, which are then translated into I2C messages. Using the GUI will ensure that UART messages are sent to the FPGA with the correct formatting. 

The tag OUTPUT_MCP4725 has a simplified version of the GUI that allows users to simply change the output voltage of the MCP4725.
